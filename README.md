## This is a simple plugin for chrome to remove cookies as they appear

### Personally, I don't like being tracked as I browse the web so..

# Usage

## IMPORTANT NOTE

Once you've downloaded the folder(repository) open the background.js file

On the second line You'll see this `const whitelist = ["github.com", "google.com", "googleapis.com", "gstatic.com"];`

Add which ever site's you wish to allow cookies in. I've set github and the google ecosystem because otherwise it won't let you sign into google or github

- Clone or Download this repository(folder)
- Go to google and open chrome extensions `chrome://extensions/`
- toggle the developer mode button top right of screen
- click load unpacked
- find where you saved the hide-cookie-banner folder and select it

Enjoy.
